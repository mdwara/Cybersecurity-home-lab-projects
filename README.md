# Cybersecurity Home Lab Projects (CompTIA Security+)

Welcome to my **Cybersecurity Home Lab** repository!  
This is a growing collection of hands-on lab projects built to align with **CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701)** objectives. Each lab simulates real-world environments and scenarios to help reinforce key cybersecurity concepts such as system hardening, vulnerability assessment, and network defense.
